## 📖 About This Project

This repository is a collection of **self-driven mini projects** designed to reinforce my understanding of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Rather than just learning theory, each concept is applied to a real-world scenario or interactive application.

> 💡 *"The best way to learn is by doing."*

## ✅ Currently Implemented

### 📋 Lists
Exploring Python lists through practical applications:

| Project | Description | Concepts Used |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **🏋️ Gym Log** | Track gym members entering and leaving the building | `append()`, `remove()`, list iteration, user input handling |
| **🎮 Player Inventory** | Manage a game character's inventory system | `append()`, `remove()`, `len()`, conditional logic |

**Key List Operations Covered:**
- ➕ Adding elements with `append()`
- ➖ Removing elements with `remove()`
- 🔍 Checking membership with `in` operator
- 📊 Getting list length with `len()`
- 🔄 Iterating through lists
